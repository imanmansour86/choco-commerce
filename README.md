## Features

The app has several components: Home, NavTabs, SingleProduct, RouteChangeTracker, Cart, CheckoutForm, Login and Signup. The app uses reducers and store context to store cartItems, which are made accessible for the rest of the components who need access to it. The reducer is first initialized with empty array to hold cartItems. The reducer has several dispatch actions: ADD_TO_CART, UPDATE_CART_QUANTITY,REMOVE_FROM_CART,CLEAR_CART and INITIALIZE.

```
const StoreProvider = ({ value = [], ...props }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useProductReducer({
    cartItems: [],
  });

  return <Provider value={[state, dispatch]} {...props} />;
};
```

## Models

The app has User,Product,Order and Order_Details modals. There is a one to many relationship between User and Order, established by user_id foreign key. There is also a many to many relationship between Product and Order modals, established through a third assosicarion table, Order_Details. It holds the product_id, order_id and quantity.
